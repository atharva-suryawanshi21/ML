    "1. Introduction to Transfer Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.\n",
    "- It leverages the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem.\n",
    "2. Why Transfer Learning?:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transfer learning saves time and computational resources since you start with a model that has already learned useful features from a large dataset.\n",
    "- It often leads to better performance, especially when you have limited data for the specific task you want to solve."
